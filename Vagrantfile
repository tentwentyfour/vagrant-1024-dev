  # All Vagrant configuration is done here. The most common configuration
  # options are documented and commented below. For a complete reference,
  # please see the online documentation at vagrantup.com.

  # Every Vagrant virtual environment requires a box to build off of.
  config.vm.box = "1024-dev"

  # The url from where the 'config.vm.box' box will be fetched if it
  # doesn't already exist on the user's system.
  config.vm.box_url = "http://www.1024.lu/vagrant/debian71.box"

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 8080
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 9000, host: 9001
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 8000, host: 8000

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.10.24"

  # The guest's /var/www folder should be mapped to the dev folder inside 
  # this vagrant working directory
  config.vm.synced_folder "./dev", "/var/www", id: "vagrant-root"

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  # config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
    # vb.gui = false
    #   # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
    # vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]
  # end
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you're using for more
  # information on available options.

  # Install puppet
  # Included in 1024-dev box 
  # config.vm.provision :shell, :inline =>
  #  "sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude -y install puppet"

  # Enable provisioning with Puppet stand alone.  Puppet manifests
  # are contained in a directory path relative to this Vagrantfile.
  # You will need to create the manifests directory and a manifest in
  # the file base.pp in the manifests_path directory.
  #
  #
  config.vm.provision :puppet do |puppet|
    puppet.module_path = "puppet/modules"
    puppet.manifests_path = "puppet/manifests"
    puppet.manifest_file  = "1024.pp"
    puppet.options = ['--verbose']
  end
